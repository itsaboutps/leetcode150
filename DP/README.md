When to Use DP?

You need to solve a problem with sequential decisions (e.g., buy/sell stocks).
The problem has overlapping subproblems (e.g., calculating minPrice repeatedly).
The solution can be built incrementally (e.g., day-by-day profit).



Situations Where DP Shines:

Maximization/Minimization Problems: Like maximizing profit, minimizing cost, etc.
Counting Problems: E.g., "How many ways to climb stairs?"
Sequential Decision Problems: Where decisions at each step affect future steps (e.g., stock trading).
